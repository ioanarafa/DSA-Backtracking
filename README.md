Year I, semester II: Data structures and algorithms

course twelve: Backtracking 

Definition: Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.

Problem backtracking1 : Generate all permutations from 1 to n.
